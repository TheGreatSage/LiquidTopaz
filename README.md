# LiquidTopaz

This is a early work in progress game/game engine for [Dart][]. The Main focus is on the development of RougeLike games.
A lot of the code is probably pretty bad but oh well.

## Credits

The Original inspiration and a lot of the starting code can be found at the [Hauberk][] source.
Hauberk runs on [Malison][] and [Piecemeal][].
Both Malison and Piecemeal have been added into this repo for editing.

So I would like to thank [Munificent][] (aka Bob Nystrom).
